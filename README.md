# Letter Recognition Program

## Overview

This project is focused on developing a machine learning-based letter recognition program. The goal is to create a system that can recognize letters from real-time video feeds. This project is a learning exercise aimed at understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms for optical character recognition (OCR).

## Current Status

The project is currently in progress. The foundational setup for capturing video and processing frames is complete. The next steps involve training a machine learning model and integrating it with real-time video processing to recognize and display letters.

## Features (in progress)

- Real-time video capture using OpenCV.
- Basic framework for letter recognition.
- Placeholder for machine learning model integration.

## Progress
- Recognition of letters:
    - a visualized as a 0
    - z visualized as a 25

## Database
Currently, there are approximately 150 images per letter in the training database.
